## Style Guidelines:

- The concepts of civic duty and modern, friendly technology inform our color palette choices. Given those values, a dark color scheme feels most appropriate, as it's a nice match for technology products. Our primary color is a calm but distinguished shade of blue (#FF8600).
- Background color: A desaturated version of the primary color will provide a sophisticated and modern feel. Choose a very dark shade (#FBF8F8).
- Accent color: A violet hue complements the primary blue, providing contrast without disrupting the calm tone (#2353ec).
- Roboto or Google Sans for a clean, readable interface.
- Centralized content within rectangular containers for focus and clarity, plus round elements.
- Simple icons that reflect the theme of voting and leadership. Ensure these are easy to understand.
- Subtle transitions and animations on button presses and results reveals.
